# **CSS Snowman**

## Summary

In this project, we'll use our HTML/CSS skills to make our very own winter snowman! Complete with all the usual fixings, as well as some additional accessories, you'll use your understanding of CSS positioning and shapes to make an image greater than the sum of its parts.

## **Part I: Technical Foundations**

*Create the basis of your project in HTML. These specs must be met for the project to be accepted.*

* [x] **File Structure:** Project consists of one .html file and one external .css file properly linked.
* [x] **Code Organization:** CSS is organized with comments labelling major sections (e.g., body, face, etc.).
* [x] **Naming:** Class and ID names are meaningful (e.g., .snowman-head, not .div1).
* [x] **Centering:** The entire snowman is centered horizontally on the page using CSS (Flexbox, Grid, or Margin).
* [x] **No Images:** The project is built entirely with HTML/CSS, no pre-rendered images


## **Part II: The Snowman

*First, we'll create the basics of our snowman.*

* [x] **The Body:** Three distinct circular segments (head, torso, base) are present and stacked vertically.
* [x] **Proportions:** There is a clear distinction between the head, torso, and 'legs' of the snowman.
* [x] **Facial Features:** AT LEAST Two eyes and one triangular carrot nose are present and positioned correctly on the head.
* [ ] **Accessories:** The snowman includes a decorative hat (with a ribbon), a scarf, and two branch arms.
* [x] **Anatomy:** Arms are positioned on the torso; the scarf appears at the "neck" between the head and torso.

## **Part III: Styling & Advanced Techniques**

*Once we have the basics, let's add some details to our snowman*
* [x] **Depth & Realism:** CSS gradients or box-shadows are used to create a 3D spherical effect on the body segments.
* [x] **Transform:** CSS rotate or skew is used effectively (e.g., angling the arms or tilting the hat).
* [x] **Detailing:** Branch arms include "finger" twigs, and the scarf features draping or texture.
* [x] **Creative Flair:** At least one unique enhancement is present (e.g., falling snow, a background landscape, or a coal smile).
